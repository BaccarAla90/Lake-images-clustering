# Lake-images-clustering
Lake images clustering based on climatic data.

In this project, we tried to cluster the Ichkeul lake(Tunisie) images, which we had collected from google earth in order to predict the borders of the lake in the future, without running to the image reconstruction techniques such as GAN which require so much data and time.

For the image dataSet of Ichkeul lake, we collected 51 images of different date, from 1988 to 2020, so we extracted the borders using the polygon command in google earth then we saved in the format of kml file, after that we used the application ArcGis to convert the kml file to a JPEG file.

## Further clarifications are explained in the jupyter notebook attached in the materials section.
